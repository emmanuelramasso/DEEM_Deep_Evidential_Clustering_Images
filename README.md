# DEEM for Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Image Clustering under Uncertainty

This code implements "DEEM: A Novel Approach to Semi-Supervised and Unsupervised Image Clustering under Uncertainty using Belief Functions and Convolutional Neural Networks", published in International Journal of Approximate Reasoning, available here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X25000416.

Two versions are proposed: One in MATLAB, one in Python. The Python version includes several examples and distance-metric learning. 

The documentation is described in the Python repository, see documentation_fr.md (french) and documentation_en.md (english).
